- Added config file for server settings (config/local.json). The example file `config/local.conf.EXAMPLE` shows usage and is tracked by `git`. The `config/local.conf` is not tracked by `git` so that local settings will not be clobbered by `git pull`.
- Added command line options for help and to set the server port (`node app.js -h` for usage).

### Fixed Bugs

- After switching a zone, the zone_id did not update for the controls. This could lead to controlling the previous zone with the new zone's controls.
- Tweaked jquery.simplemarquee.js to use "span" instead of "div". Caused problems with CSS layouts.
